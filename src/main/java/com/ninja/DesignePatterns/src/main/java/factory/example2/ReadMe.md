In this example, I’ll create a simple “dog factory” that can return a
variety of Dog types, where the “Dog” that is returned matches the criteria
I specify. For instance, I might tell the factory that I want a small dog,
or a large dog, and the dog factory will give me a dog of the type I asked for.
